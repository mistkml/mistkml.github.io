Containerization
----------------

All processes (including agents and orchestrators) in the MISTK ecosystem run as Docker containers
and require a **Dockerfile** to configure the runtime image.  The **Dockerfiles**
below runs the Test Agent example.
It includes the essentials for running within MISTK that can be used for any agent,
however agents are free to add any customizations to their runtime image:

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_gaming_files/Dockerfile
    :linenos:
    :language: guess

The final CMD line starts the agent and sets up its endpoints.  The third
argument (`test_agent.agent`) is the package/module of our agent
and the fourth argument (`TestAgent`) is the agent class name.

To update this Dockerfile for a new agent, a model developer would update the install path
on lines 13-14 and the model path and name on line 18. The MISTK whl
denoted on line 8 will need to be added to the folder where the Dockerfile is also.

The setup.py script referenced above is a standard python setup install script
which lists the python package dependencies for the agent:

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_gaming_files/setup.py
    :linenos:
    :language: python
