Welcome to the Model Integration Software ToolKit (MISTK)
=========================================================

This is the documentation for the Model Integration Software ToolKit (MISTK) SDK.
MISTK is an ecosystem for integrating, validating, and evaluating machine learning
models and algorithms. This guide serves to instruct a developer on adapting
a machine learning model for use within the ecosystem by implementing the model
interface, running the implemented model as a web service, testing and validating
the model implementation, and packaging the model as a Docker image for distribution.
