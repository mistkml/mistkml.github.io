MISTK Python Library
--------------------

The MISTK python library is available as both source code and Python
wheel files at the `MISTK Github Repository`__.

.. __: https://github.com/mistkml/mistk/releases

Installation
------------

In order to develop algorithms to be integrated into MISTK, the
MISTK Core Library (and its dependencies) must be available on
PYTHONPATH.

You can download them down from the MISTK Github Repository `Releases page`__
and install the wheel files with `pip`::

    pip install mistk-*-py3-none-any.whl

.. __: https://github.com/mistkml/mistk/releases

Verify that mistk is now installed on PYTHON PATH by running::

    >>> import mistk
