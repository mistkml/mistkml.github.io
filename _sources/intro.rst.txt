Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 3.6
* Python Pip
* Docker

Pip repository
----------------------

The python dependencies are deployed to a PyPi repository. To
access them, you must add the repository to your pip environment.

Installation
------------

In order to develop algorithms to be integrated into MISTK, the
MISTK Core Library (and its dependencies) must be available on
PYTHONPATH.

You can download them down from the MISTK Github Repository `Releases page`__
and install the wheel files `pip` with::

    pip install mistk-*-py3-none-any.whl

.. __: https://github.com/mistkml/mistk/releases

Verify that mistk is now installed on PYTHON PATH by running::

    >>> import mistk
