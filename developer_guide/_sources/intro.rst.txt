Introduction
=============

This is the documentation for the Model Integration Software ToolKit (MISTK) SDK.
MISTK is an ecosystem for integrating, validating, and evaluating machine learning
models and algorithms. This guide serves to instruct a developer on adapting
a machine learning model for use within the ecosystem by implementing the model
interface, running the implemented model as a web service, testing and validating
the model implementation, and packaging the model as a Docker image for distribution.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 3.6
* Python Pip
* Docker

Pip repository
----------------------

The python dependencies are deployed to a PyPi repository. To
access them, you must add the repository to your pip environment.

Installation
------------

In order to develop algorithms to be integrated into MISTK, the
MISTK Core Library (and its dependencies) must be available on
PYTHONPATH.

You can pull them down from the PyPi repository using `pip` with::

    pip install mistk

Verify that mistk is now installed on PYTHON PATH by running::

    >>> import mistk


Assumptions
-----------

MISTK developers are assumed to understand:
